# Allot

A way of defining interfaces from one JavaScript class to a new class.

The idea is still a little abstract at the moment however its useful for building quick interfaces from one class to another.

## Usage


### `allot.factory`
  Builds a new class based upon SuperClass.


#### Static methods from instance methods

```js

function SuperClass() {
};

SuperClass.prototype.doSomething = function () {
  return 'Hello there';
};

var ChildClass = allot.factory(SuperClass, {
  staticProxyPrototypes: ['doSomething']
});

ChildClass.doSomething();

var instance = new ChildClass();

```

#### Static methods from static methods

```js

function SuperClass() {
};

SuperClass.doSomething = function () {
  return 'Hello there';
};

var ChildClass = allot.factory(SuperClass, {
  staticProxyMethods: ['doSomething']
});

ChildClass.doSomething();

var instance = new ChildClass();

```
